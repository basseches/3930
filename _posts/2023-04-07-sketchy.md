        It's easy to get caught up in the busyness of everyday life. Remember
        when things were simple, and you didn't have to worry about debt,
        traffic, paying rent, and taxes? Connect with your inner child using
        the <i>Esp-A-Skesp</i>* (like an
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch">Etch-A-Sketch,</a>
        but with an ESP32)!
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        This is a program that reads input from a joystick and a button and
        writes on the screen, like an Etch-A-Sketch. The joystick moves the
        "cursor" on the screen, and pressing the button clears the screen.

        I've written out the steps I took to configure the Arduino IDE
        <a href="/3930/arduino">here.</a>
    </p>
    <h3>Wiring and hardware</h3>
    <p>
        I used 7 wires, 5 female-to-female and 2 female-to-male. For the
        joystick, I connected ground on the joystick to ground on the ESP32
        (black wire), 5V to a 3V3 pin (red wire), VRX to pin 13 (yellow), VRY
        to pin 12 (brown), and SW to pin 25 (orange):
    </p>

        <img src="/3930/assets/static/posts/pinout.png" width=370>
    </div>
    <p>
        You can switch up the pins for X, Y, and SW, but X and Y must be ADC
        pins. The button connects to the ESP32 with two wires: one to ground
        and one to pin 15. I used all female-to-female wires for the joystick
        as a design choice, since I was enclosing the devices in a small box.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h3>Enclosure</h3>
    <p>
        I wanted my enclosure to imitate an actual Etch-A-Sketch as faithfully
        as possible. I figured that I'd inevitably run into some logistical
        difficulties, though, so my main (attainable) goal with the enclosure
        was to evoke that retro aesthetic: solid, bright colors and chunky,
        awkward text. I had originally intended to 3D-print the box for the
        enclosure. I made some sketches on paper first, using the dimensions of
        the ESP32 andapproximating the dimensions of the joystick and my USB-C
        cord, then used <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/">OnShape</a> to
        create a CAD file for my design.
    </p>
    <div class="padding">
        <img src="/3930/assets/static/posts/blue.png" width=300>
        <img src="/3930/assets/static/posts/cad.png" width=300>
    </div>
    <p>
        One design choice that I'd change in a future iteration was the
        placement of the button on a breadboard outside of my enclosure. I
        didn't have another, smaller breadboard that would fit inside of my
        enclosure, and I wanted to keep the dimensions as small as possible,
        given how small the screen on the ESP32 is. Instead, I added a little
        hole in the enclosure wall for the wires to connect the ESP32 inside to
        the breadboard outside.
        <br>
        <br>
        I went to the Makerspace with my design, and—after a chat with my
        friend Nader—decided that laser cutting would be a better choice than
        3D-printing (for a few reasons: the printers were all taken, he told me
        it'd take upwards of 12 hours to print this, color is not guaranteed,
        and the "right" choice for boxes is laser cutting). Material choice
        with the laser cutter is much more flexible, and I was able to cut on
        a nice, red 6mm acrylic. Because I was laser cutting now, my CAD file
        was useless, but luckily it wasn't too much work to port things over to
        <a href="https://www.thunderlaser.com/downloads/"> Thunder Laser's
        software.</a> I used <a href="https://en.makercase.com/#/">this
        website's</a> premade templates for the box's body with the following
        settings:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic box template</li>
            <li>Width: 70mm; height: 35mm; depth: 70mm</li>
            <li>Inside dimensions</li>
            <li>6mm thickness (for my material)</li>
            <li>Open box</li>
            <li>Finger joint (finger width: 14.25mm)</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        The lid for the box was also 70mm x 70mm, with a cut out circle (20mm
        diameter) for the joystick and a 32mm x 17.6mm window for the ESP32. I
        added some holes for the USB-C and for the outgoing wires to the
        button. I used the default settings for the laser cutter (listed at the
        Makerspace). My first iteration used a closed box, with fingers on the
        lid, but after cutting, I didn't like how clunky it ended up looking,
        so I separated the lid from the body.

        I assembled with acrylic glue (definitely crazy toxic, I felt days being
        taken off of my lifespan while using it...). I used a paint marker to
        fill in the engraved text. At this point, I started sanding down the
        edges to round them out. While this isn't an <i>essential</i> detail,
        I really liked the look of the fillets in my CAD design. This was
        definitely the most tedious part of the process, and took a few hours.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        With the enclosure finished, I stuffed everything in the box (I
        underestimated the depth of the box a bit, so the wires were a bit
        squashed, but it still worked). I had to put some paper and an eraser
        into the box to "mount" the joystick, which took some trial and error.
        I glued the top of the box on, but not with acrylic glue, since I
        wanted to be able to disassemble after I was done.

        superusers, and were great help along the way ❤️
